## Methodologies

* Elaborate on SCRUM
* Describe the 4 steps of risk analysis
* Explain how one relates to risk analysis within:
	- RUP
	- Extreme Programming
* Explain phase-division, milestones and iterations within SCRUM and RUP
* Explain the relevance of the extreme programming practices pair programming, on-site customer and collective ownership in SCRUM and RUP 
* Argue for which three practices of XP you believe have the most influence on how maintenance of the software will be upon completion

## Models, Diagrams & Tools
* Gantt
* Use Case model
* Domain model
* Deployment diagram
* System sequence diagram (UML)
* Explain how a repository-based tool allows several programmers to work simultaneously on the same source code without versioning conflicts
	- Explain how size can be kept down even though tens of programmers may constantly be adding new code
* Object Oriented Analysis
* Burn Down Chart
